SFML Game Of Life and Variations


Algorithm:
We'll create a Cell class, that holds these methods and properties:
    - state
        - Boolean that holds whether the Cell is on or off.
    - position
        - Integer vector that holds the x,y position of the Cell.

Then, there'll be a board class, that'll be a wrapper for a 2-dimensional std::vector:
    - board
        - vector< vector<Cell> >

So technically, I started the project last night but wanted to start fresh this morning as I didn't really like the codeI wrote last night. I wrote some new code and got the Cell class working. Maybe I should test as I go this time.
